# SeattleListings
<h2>Installations</h2>

 The Anaconda distribution of Python should be enough to run the code with no issues.

<h2>Project Motivation</h2>

In this project, i used Seattle AirBNB data, in which it includes information of the listings offered in Seattle, WA.

after exploring the data, I got curious about the following questions: 

- How many listings are in each neighbourhood? 

- Which hosts are running a business with multiple listings and where they? 

- Average of prices for each neighborhood? 

- and building a model for Price Predections for listings

<h2>Description of File</h2>

A notebook is available to showcase work related to the above question. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the code.


<h2>Acknoweldgement</h2>

Credit goes to AirBnB for providing the dataset. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data" >here</a>.
