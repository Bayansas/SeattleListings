# SeattleListings
<h2>installations</h2>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.

<h2>Project Motivation</h2>

In this project, i used Seattle AirBNB data, in which it includes information of the listings offered in Seattle, WA.

after exploring the data, I got curious about the following questions: 

- How many listings are in each neighbourhood? 

- Which hosts are running a business with multiple listings and where they? 

- Average of prices for each neighborhood? 

- and building a model for Price Predections for listings
