# SeattleListings
<h2>Installations</h2>

 The Anaconda distribution of Python should be enough to run the code with no issues.

<h2>Project Motivation</h2>

In this project, i used Seattle AirBNB data, in which it includes information of the listings offered in Seattle, WA.

after exploring the data, I got curious about the following questions: 

- How many listings are in each neighbourhood? 

- Which hosts are running a business with multiple listings? 

- Average of prices for each neighborhood? 

- and building a model for Price Predections for listings

<h2>Description of File</h2>

A notebook is available to showcase work related to the above question. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the code.

<h2>Summary of Analysis</h2>

After analysing the data, I have got the following insights:

- Number of listings for each neighborhood included in the dataset, although there are nearly 800 records with no clear neighborhood name but I can tell that Capitol Hill won with the highest listings with 566.
- A list of all hosts who own more than one listing in Seattle and found out that one of the hosts owns a total of 169 listings which the highest among the list.
- The average of daily prices of each neighborhoods.Magnolia neghiborhood has the heighest daily price (177 USD ) where Delridge has the lowest (83 USD).
- Built a model to predict listings prices based on some features. The model R-squared was 0.51 so that means that approximately half of the observed variation can be explained by the model's inputs.
